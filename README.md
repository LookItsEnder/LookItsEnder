      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>I am a college student at UW-Whitewater. When I am not building things with my breadboard and electrical components or reading an incredibly long error message on my console, I do Math for fun or play video games with my friends!</p>

        <li>I love robotics! In grade school, I did a robotics club (SumoBot and FIRST robotics) and enjoy tinkering with random "junk" I find around my shop.</li>
        <li>I started coding when I was 9 in an elementary school class and picked it up on and off to make calculators for my math and physics classes later on. (Efficiency >>>)</li>
        <li>Obviously, I play video games, and I love sandboxes and shooters; some of my favorites are ULTRAKILL and Minecraft.</li>
