      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>I am a college student (dun dun duuun). When I am not accidentally blowing up electrical components on my breadboard or reading an incredibly long error message on my console, I am doing math for fun, or playing random games I find in my Steam library.</p>

      <h3>Some stuff about me:</h3>
      <ul> 
        <li>I love robotics! In grade school, I did a robotics club (SumoBot and FIRST robotics) and I enjoy tinkering with random "junk" I find around my shop.</li>
        <li>I started coding when I was 9 in an elementary school class and picked it up on and off to make calculators for my math and physics classes later on. (Efficiency >>>)</li>
        <li>Obviously, I play video games, and I love sandboxes and shooters; some of my favorites right now are ULTRAKILL and Minecraft.</li>
